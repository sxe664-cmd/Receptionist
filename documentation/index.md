# AI Receptionist — Documentation

An open-source, high-fidelity AI phone receptionist built on the **OpenAI Realtime API** (speech-to-speech) and the **LiveKit Agents SDK** (Python). Designed for small businesses — dental offices, law firms, medical clinics, and more — that need reliable inbound call handling with FAQ answering, call transfers, and message taking.

## Why AI Receptionist?

Traditional IVR systems frustrate callers with rigid menus. Human receptionists are expensive and unavailable 24/7. AI Receptionist bridges the gap:

- **Natural conversation** — powered by OpenAI's speech-to-speech Realtime API, callers interact with a human-sounding voice, not a robotic menu.
- **Config-driven** — every aspect of the receptionist's behavior (greeting, personality, hours, FAQs, routing) is defined in a single YAML file. No code changes needed.
- **Multi-business** — run one deployment that serves multiple businesses, each with its own configuration and phone number.
- **Open-source** — MIT-licensed, extensible, and built on well-supported foundations (LiveKit, OpenAI, Pydantic).

| [Telephony Setup](telephony-setup.md) | Trade-offs between porting your number to a SIP trunk provider (Path A), bringing your own carrier via BYOC (Path B), and keeping a copper landline via an FXS gateway + on-prem PBX (Path C). |
| [RingCentral + Twilio Setup](ringcentral-setup.md) | Reception-group deployment using a Twilio DID as the RingCentral external member and LiveKit SIP bridge. |
| [Appointment Reminders](reminders-setup.md) | Send immediate booking confirmations and schedule 4-day/1-day email/SMS appointment reminders from Google events and Apple `.ics` imports. |
| [Development Guide](development-guide.md) | Local development setup, running tests, code organization, and contribution guidelines. |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-receptionist.git
cd ai-receptionist

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# 4. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LiveKit and OpenAI credentials

# 5. Create your business config
cp config/businesses/example-dental.yaml config/businesses/my-business.yaml
# Edit my-business.yaml to match your business

# 6. Run the agent in development mode
python -m receptionist.agent dev
```

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Voice AI | OpenAI Realtime API | Speech-to-speech conversation (no separate STT/TTS) |
| Agent Framework | LiveKit Agents SDK (Python) | Agent lifecycle, session management, SIP integration |
| Noise Cancellation | LiveKit Noise Cancellation Plugin | BVCTelephony (SIP) / BVC (WebRTC) noise suppression |
| Configuration | Pydantic + PyYAML | Typed config models with validation |
| Transport | LiveKit Server + SIP | WebRTC-based media transport with PSTN bridging |
| SIP Trunking | Twilio / Telnyx | Connects PSTN phone numbers to LiveKit |

---

## Cost Estimate

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| OpenAI Realtime API | ~$0.20-0.30/min | Speech-to-speech model usage |
| SIP Trunking | ~$0.01-0.02/min | Twilio or Telnyx per-minute rates |
| LiveKit Cloud | Varies | Free tier available; pay-as-you-go beyond that |
| **Typical dental office** | **~$450/month** | 30 calls/day, 2 min average call duration |

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** (tested on 3.14.2, Windows 11)
- **LiveKit Server** — Cloud account or self-hosted instance
- **OpenAI auth** — either an API key with Realtime API access or [ChatGPT OAuth](chatgpt-oauth-setup.md) through Codex CLI
- **SIP Trunk** — Twilio or Telnyx account for phone number connectivity
